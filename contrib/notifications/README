TePiNot - TerrariumPiNotification Version 0.1 -> renamed logcheck

This is a Python-script to parse the logfile from TerrariumPI and send a notification over ntfy.

To automate the script, just add a cronjob.

Dependencies:
Python
ntfy	-	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ntfy
pygtail	-	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygtail
parse	-	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parse

Function:
The script opens the logfile of TerrariumPI with pygtail. Pygtail allows the script to start 
behind the last read row of the log.
With parse, the different lines will be parsed. Ntfy is used for sending notifications.

The script itself parses the read lines and searches for the log-Levels and the modules.
If the script finds a logfile-line containing a module in combination with a log-level, 
you'll get one or more notifications, depending on your ntfy-config.

A log-file is written, at the path you defined in the config-file.

In Debug-Mode will be more output.

Configuration:
To configure ntfy, use the described website.
It's possible to use the default-config-file of ntfy, or you creat an additional config-file. In this case, you can add the path to it into the tepinot.conf. 


That config-file also holds the path to its logfile, to the logfile of TerrariumPI and the searched modules/log-Levels written into the TerrariumPi-logfile.
For activating the search for a specific module or log-level, just uncomment the respective keyword.

Last but not least, you can enable the "Debug-Mode".
